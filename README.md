This is my first task at Minfy Technologies on git and github.

I have initialiazed a github repository and created a read.txt file.

After making the file I put it in the staging area and committed it using comment "Initial commit".

Then I made some changes(added 1 more line) then I repeated the process by using conventional commit formats.
